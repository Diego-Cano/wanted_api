# wanted_api
Assignment for my Web app class

1.	Documentation and Testing:
The FBI Wanted Search web application allows users to search for wanted individuals using the FBI's public API. It features a simple user interface for entering search wanted people by FBI office including titles and descriptions of wanted individuals. Additionally, it showcases a "Most Wanted" list to immediately engage users with high-profile cases.

I have tested the API, and it has worked with multiple entries. The only issue that I have encountered is that it requires searching on a Strick matter of lowcase and single-word terms.

Setup Instructions

-	Prerequisites: Ensure you have a modern web browser installed.
-	Download the Application: Clone or download the application files to your local machine. The application consists of three main files:
index.html: The main HTML document.
app.js: The JavaScript file that handles API requests and UI interactions.
styles.css: The CSS file for styling the application.
-	Open the Application.
-	Internet Connection.
2.	Write up:
I chose this API because I thought it was cool to work with such data. It is meant to be used for research purposes, so people can be aware of the wanted people by the FBI in any desired region within the US. 
	Challenges Encountered:
-API limitations: not as much documentation.
- Data presentation: deciding how much data to show.
